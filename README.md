# Life Extension AI

This is a big project that we broke into five
separate microservices.  The frontends are in this
directory.

There is also a python server that has the database.

There is a python backend server that talks to Google Vertex AI LLM.

There are two TruLens projects, one to help us make the ads, and one
to help us search the abstracts.
